# retro_Image
this project is meant to replicate a snapchat filter that makes the camera and image look as if it were from 15 years ago by reducing the resolution.

another interestring goal would be to compress a string with information about the photo to make the image size much smaller, with a key algorithim to decrypt it once recieved on another end 
maybe to test there could be a website that runs the algorithim and someone can paste in the string that is compressed and then view the image 


The base code for this is done.
